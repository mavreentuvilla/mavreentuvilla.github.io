1) If needing to change data, just change values for existing entries. Do now copy-paste new fields
*NOTE: The template provided below is just for documentation. Do not try to add many such units, as is done when updating research.json
{
"name":"",
"designation":"",
"image":"",
"contact":[
	{
	    "show":true,
	    "linkNotPopup":false,
	    "data":"",
	    "dataExtra:"";
	    "faFont":"",
	    "bsButton":""
	},
	{
	    "show":true,
	    "linkNotPopup":false,
	    "data":"",
	    "faFont":"",
	    "bsButton":""
	}
],
"fullDescription":["This forms para-1","This forms para-2","This forms para-3"],
"quote": {
		"show":true/false,
		"quoteText":"",
		"author":"",
		"sourceText":"",
		"sourceLink":""
	}
}


2) Instructions to add data:
2.1) Name - Your name, as you would like it to appear
2.2) Designation - Your current designation, as you would like it to appear
2.3) Image - Your photo to show on webpage. First, add an image in image-folder, not in data-folder. For the value to be put, use "image/{imageFileName}", putting appropriate imageFileName
2.4) Contact - the link for contact. Following are the instructions:
2.4.1) Enter false for "show" if you don't want that contact to show. If "show" has value of true, then do enter all other details. 
2.4.2) Enter "linkNotPopup" as true if the value being entered in "data" field is a web-link. If it is plain data, like building number, then set linkNotPopup=false. Note that popups also work on mobile devices. So setting as popup won't do harm
2.4.3) In data field, enter the corresponding data (a plain data, or web-link). If there is no value to be put, set "linkNotPopup" as true, set data as "#". Do not leave fields empty. Note that a logic will be put on webpage such that if the provided link is a popup, not link (i.e. linkNotPopup=false), then user will be given option to copy this data. For dataExtra field, provide a value only if linkNotPopup=false. In this case, dataExtra will be added to popup, but when user clicks popup, this data will not be copied. Example: popup can contai building address - that goes in data field so tha it gets copied. User may also provide Google Maps link to address, we don't want that copied, so it goes in dataExtra field
2.4.4) These apply to both "faFont" and "bs-Button" fields:
2.4.4.1) DO NOT change value of "faFont" and "bsButton". 
2.4.4.2) DO NOT delete the entries already made else "faFont" and "bsButton" values will be lost. Simply set show to false if a certain contact link is not supposed to be shown. 
2.4.4.3) For bootstrap buttons, Reference: https://lipis.github.io/bootstrap-social/
2.4.4.4) For buttons where there is no boot-strap social button, just use default value of "btn-primary" so that it shows in blue
2.4.5) If new contact button is needed, make sure to write valid json, search for bootstrap button and font-awesome icon
2.5) fullDescription - Complete description about yourself. Add as many individual entries needed, encloded within "..", and ending with comma. Also note:
2.5.1) The text should be a properly formatted html.
2.5.2) Do NOT start a new paragraph in one entry of full description. Only one paragraph in one entry
2.5.3) If you are putting any html attributes, like, <img src=\"...\" ...>, then put the attribute-value within \" i.e., doule quote preceeded by a backslash. If you need to use quotes anywhere else in text, follow ADDIIONAL INSTRUCTIONS in Section 3
2.6) Quote - If you want to show a quote at bottom of your profile. If you DO NOT WANT the quote, set "show" value to false, else keep it true. Give a quoteText - give this value necessarily if "show" is true. Give an author name (optional). Give a source only if author name is also provided - sourceText shows the text that will be visible, sourceLink gives the link to that text. ALSO NOTE: Try to keep quote small and not include any major html formatting, except, like <i>, <b>, etc. Do not start the quote-text with <p> element.


3) ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:
At any time, DO NOT insert quote-symbol in any value. If you need to insert inverted quote, use: 
" => &quot;
' => &apos;
For more "sophistication", use
&ldquo; = left-double quote (double quote put on opening, at left)
&rdquo; = right-double quote (double quote put on ending, at right)
&lsquo; = left-single quote
&rsquo; = right-single quote (as done for apostophe)
